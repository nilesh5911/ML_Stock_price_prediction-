# ML_Stock_price_prediction-
Stock price prediction is a complex task due to various factors influencing market movements. Predicting stock prices using machine learning involves analyzing historical data and using various algorithms to forecast future prices. This process can be broken down into several steps, including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
●	This project was made using Machine Learning Models like stacked LSTM model with three LSTM layers.
●	The code includes the creation and training of Dilated CNN and CNN-LSTM models.
●	The model's performance was evaluated on the test set using MAE.
●	code includes plotting the actual vs. predicted values for visual comparison.
●	MAE metric provides a quantitative measure of the prediction error.
